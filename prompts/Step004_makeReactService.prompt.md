After familiarizing yourself with the instructions up to this point, list all the React service classes you will need for this system.
- List the method names, arguments, return values, and description.
- If multiple patterns are possible, choose the simpler design.
- The service list should be reviewed by professionals such as UI/UX designers, security specialists, business analysts, strict consistency checker,  etc., and an improved version should be presented with their input.(The consistency checker will strictly check that your service list reflects all previous requirements.)
Only output the Improved React service classes(and method) List.
